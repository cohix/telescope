# Telescope ðŸ”­

Telescope is an experimental (but super cool) **Full-Stack WebAssembly Application**

That means both the web frontend AND the backend are running on Wasm! It uses the Yew project for the frontend, and the Suborbital Atmo project for the backend.

The application is a demo allowing you to view stats about an org's GitHub repos!

You can run `make app && subo dev` to run the development server on `localhost:8080`
